# Creation of a portfolio movil first with HTML5 and CSS3.
### ToDo

· Create a header with a navigation bar, which must have links to each portfolio element. All links will have to have a smoothed hover state with a transition. These links are not necessary in the mobile version.  

· A section with a description of us and our skills as progress bars. These progress bars have to be animated with css animations.  

· Banner that must have a background image. On mobile screens it must be another, to give more meaning to the design in said resolution.  

· Contact form with these inputs. They all have to have both types correct as the html validation of each input.  

· Footer with links to our social networks.  

· A video that plays when entering the website and appears with a fadeIn animation.  

· Create a grid with our projects.
